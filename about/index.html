    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Don Macchiatos started as a garage-sized caffeine cult formed by two coffee nerds with 
        questionable sleep schedules and a dangerous fascination with high-pressure espresso systems.
        What began as a messy experiment in pulling the “perfect shot” turned into a full-blown operation 
        once people kept breaking into the garage asking for refills. 
        Over the years, we’ve evolved from improvised equipment and late-night roasting sessions 
        to a proper roastery with standards, procedures, and machines that no longer catch fire.
    </p>

    <h2>Team</h2>
    <p>
        Our team is built from baristas, roasters, technicians, and coffee obsessives who treat crema 
        like holy scripture. Every member contributes to our process—from sourcing ethical beans, 
        to maintaining machines dialed tighter than a race car engine, to ensuring every cup reflects 
        the craft and chaos we were founded on. 
        We hire people who genuinely care about the ritual of coffee, not people who fake a smile 
        while steaming milk into soup.
    </p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: Is your coffee good?</strong><br>
    A: Yes. If it wasn’t, we wouldn’t sell it. We drink it, too.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Do you burn your beans?</strong><br>
    A: No. We roast with intention, not with a blowtorch.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Do you serve decaf?</strong><br>
    A: Yes, because some people need caffeine-free joy. We respect that.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Why “Don Macchiatos”?</strong><br>
    A: Long story short: too many espressos, an inside joke, and an argument about 
    who would be the “don” of the coffee world. We never resolved it, so the name stuck.</p>

    <h2>Vision & Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to produce coffee that actually tastes like coffee—complex, honest, and 
        crafted by people who understand the chemistry behind every extraction. 
        We aim to eliminate pretentious jargon and deliver coffee that proves its worth in the cup, 
        not through marketing buzzwords.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our vision is a world where great coffee is accessible, respected, and understood, 
        without forcing customers to read a dissertation to order a drink. 
        We push forward by refining our craft, improving our sourcing, and educating people 
        on why good coffee matters.
